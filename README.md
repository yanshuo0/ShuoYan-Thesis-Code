##Project Name: Knowledge Fighter
The aim of this project is to develop an open-Source User Data Importer allowing players to input their own simple questions & answers as data in a Web page. 

Then, this data will be saved in sessionStorage and imported to several game interfaces as game data.

In this way, we propose a practical method for versatile game development.
